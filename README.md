Double Quantum Dot (DQD) Charge Stability Characterization
Introduction
This project models a Double Quantum Dot (DQD) system, where two quantum dots are paired with gates to control electron movement by adjusting gate voltages. The goal is to investigate how varying gate voltages affects the charge state of the dots.

Problem Description
The DQD system is modeled using capacitance matrices to calculate the total electrostatic energy for different charge states. The task involves computing these energies for various charge states and gate voltage combinations, identifying the lowest energy state for each combination, and visualizing the results in a heatmap.

Task Objectives
Compute Electrostatic Energies: Calculate the total electrostatic energy for each charge state and unique gate voltage combination.

Determine Lowest Energy States: Identify the charge state with the lowest energy for each gate voltage combination.

Plot Heatmap: Create a heatmap displaying the lowest energy charge states for each gate voltage point.

Solution
The solution is provided in a Python notebook (*.ipynb) file, utilizing libraries like NumPy for efficient numerical computations. The code is designed to be executable as a script or notebook and includes detailed comments explaining the approach.

Output
When run, the code generates a heatmap saved as "plot.png" in the current directory.
